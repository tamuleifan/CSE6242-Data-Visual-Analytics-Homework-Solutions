"""
Below is code for the PageRank algorithm (power iteration),
most of which has been implemented for you.

Here, the binary index_file contains the mapping of each node's ID to its degree.
The node IDs range from 0 to max_node_id.
Hence, the index_file contains (max_node_id + 1) pairs of values,
each of which is of 'int' C type in little endian byte order.
The index_file is memory-mapped into the index_map object.

The binary edge_file contains the edges in the (source ID, target ID) format.
Hence, the edge_file contains edge_count pairs of values,
each of which is of 'int' C type in big endian byte order.
The edge_file is memory-mapped into the edge_map object.

Your task is to determine the correct parameters needed to
(1) initialize the memory-mapped objects (index_map and edge_map),
(2) unpack the source and target IDs from the edge_map, and
(3) upack the source ID and source degree from the index_map.

This code assumes that the node IDs start from 0 and are contiguous up to max_node_id.
Your algorithm, if implemented correctly, should return the same scores
as popular graph analysis libraries like NetworkX.
