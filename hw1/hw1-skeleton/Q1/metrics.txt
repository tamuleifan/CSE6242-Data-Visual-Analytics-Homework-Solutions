1. Average node degree = 1.679
The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. Average node degree is the average of the degree of all nodes.

2. Diameter of the graph = 11
the diameter of a network as the longest of all the calculated shortest paths in a network.

3. Average path length = 3.439
The average shortest path length is calculated by finding the shortest path between all pairs of nodes, and taking the average over all paths of the length.
